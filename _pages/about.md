I am a PhD candidate in the department of Economics, Cornell University. 

I am a macroeconomist with research interest at the intersection of monetary economics and information economics (dispersed information and the formation of expectations). I work on central bank communication from both a theoretical and empirical perspective, in particular using natural language processing techniques. 

In my job market paper, I study the state-dependent central bank communication in presence of heterogeneous beliefs. 

I am working under the supervision of [Kristoffer Nimark](http://www.kris-nimark.net/) (chair), [Chris Huckfeldt](https://huckfeldt.economics.cornell.edu/), [Julieta Caunedo](https://www.julietacaunedo.com/) and [Lars Vilhuber](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/lars-vilhuber). 

**I will be available for interviews both at the EEA Annual Meeting in Rotterdam (December, 18-19th, 2019) and the ASSA Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA (January 3rd-5th, 2020).**
