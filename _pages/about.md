I am a research economist in the monetary policy department at the Banque de France. 

I am a macroeconomist with research interest at the intersection of monetary economics and information economics (dispersed information and the formation of expectations). I work on central bank communication from both a theoretical and empirical perspective, in particular using natural language processing techniques. 

I received my PhD in economics from Cornell under the supervision of [Kristoffer Nimark](http://www.kris-nimark.net/) (chair), [Chris Huckfeldt](https://huckfeldt.economics.cornell.edu/), [Julieta Caunedo](https://www.julietacaunedo.com/) and [Lars Vilhuber](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/lars-vilhuber).
