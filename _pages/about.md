I am a PhD candidate in the department of Economics, Cornell University, working under the supervision of [Kristoffer Nimark](http://www.kris-nimark.net/), [Chris Huckfledt](https://huckfeldt.economics.cornell.edu/), [Julieta Caunedo](https://www.julietacaunedo.com/) and [Lars Vilhuber](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/lars-vilhuber). 

My research interests are in macroeconomics, in particular monetary economics, and in information economics (informational frictions and the formation of expectations). I am currently working on Central Bank Communication.
