Strategic Communication with Heterogeneous Beliefs (draft coming soon)

> This paper explores the optimal communication strategy of a sender (for instance, a central bank), who wishes to influence receivers with state-dependent payoffs to take a desired action, when their beliefs about the state are heterogeneous. With a unique receiver, as in Gentzkow and Kamenica (2011), the sender only needed to bring the receiver's belief above a threshold. With heterogeneous beliefs, she will need to consider how others react, and therefore will take into account the distribution of beliefs. We find that while it is optimal to sometimes be overly optimistic in a bad state (meaning the probability of sending a good signal in a bad state is non-zero), it is also optimal to sometimes be pessimistic in a good state, contrarily to the one-receiver case. Most importantly, we show that the lower the dispersion in beliefs, the higher the probability of sending an untruthful signal should be. Extending the model to a dynamic bayesian persuasion setting, we allow for reputation concerns and show that a persuasion equilibrium exists. We test the model's predictions empirically by showing that FOMC forecasts' biases about the unemployment rate vary with both the business cycle and the private sector disagreement, in line with our model's predictions.

 Replicability of a journal: a comprehensive overview (joint with H. Kingi, F. Stanchi and L.Vilhuber)
> Replication, reproduction, and falsification of published articles are an important part of the scientific endeavor, and have been widely discussed. The lessons learned from earlier replication exercises such as (Dewald et al, 1986) lead several journals to implement code and data depository requirements. These should have lead to improved reproducibility of journal archives, since a good part of the failure to replicate is due to poor availability of replication materials (McCullough et al, 2006). We set out to test the latter assumption. We assessed all articles published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics (AEJ:AE) as to the reproducibility of their computational results, and tested the reproducibility for all those with some data available.
